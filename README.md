# MVC Pattern with PHP

This repository demonstrates the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architectural Pattern** implemented in PHP. It serves as a practical guide to building organized, maintainable web applications by separating concerns into three distinct components: Models for data handling, Views for presentation, and Controllers for business logic.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project follows the MVC pattern with clear separation between models, views, and controllers, ensuring organized code structure and responsibilities.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* **Separation of Concerns** → Understand how to separate application logic into Models (data), Views (presentation), and Controllers (business logic)
* **More organized and modular code** → Makes project maintenance and evolution easier.
* **Testability** → The separation allows isolated unit tests for Model, View, and Controller.
* **Ease of collaboration** → Teams can work separately on the Model, View, and Controller.
* **Code reuse** → The same business logic can be used with different graphical interfaces.
* **Better scalability** → Allows adding new features without modifying the entire structure.
